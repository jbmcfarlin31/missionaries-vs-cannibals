# missionaries-vs-cannibals
A Python program of the Missionaries vs Cannibals game

# Prequisites
Python 3+ or higher

You will need PrettyTable installed for this to work
```bash
pip install PTable

# note if using Python 3 you might have to run it like so:
pip3 install PTable
```

# How to Play
The task is simple - move all of the missionaries and cannibals from side of the bank to the other. Easy, right?

The boat can only have two people on board, and there has to be one person to drive the boat back to the other side.

# Pit falls
If at any point on either side of the bank the cannibals out number the missionaries, they will eat the missionaries, and you will lose.
